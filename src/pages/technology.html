                <p class="header__description-text">The term "slab" refers to a flat cut of natural stone with specific patterns. Each piece is unique, like a fingerprint of nature's grandeur, born in its depths. Today, these blanks are highly popular for creating furniture elements, decorating spaces, and construction. Stone slabs attract not only luxury connoisseurs but also those who love natural materials with characteristic textures of natural minerals</p>
                <p class="header__description-text">They have a long lifespan and the ability to organically fit into any interior: modern, classic, loft, Scandinavian, Gothic, modern, country, etc. The key is to select the material that matches the color and texture of the room's design.</p>

                    <p class="main__list_mobile-item-description">The stone is extracted from the quarry using the latest cutting technologies, such as DAZZINI wire saw machines, Sandvik Tamrock and DAZZINI PCT 100 self-propelled drilling rigs. The extracted stone is transported to the production site using VOLVO F350 and VOLVO E220 front loaders. Automated block-turning devices from FRAVIZEL are used to preserve the integrity and quality of the raw material.</p>

                    <p class="main__list_mobile-item-description">The extracted stone in the form of large blocks is processed with fully automated equipment from the Italian manufacturer PEDRINI. The first stage is block squaring using the PEDRINI JUPITER GS210, which ensures the correct geometry of the future slab. The company cares for the environment by purifying the water used for stone cutting with advanced equipment from TECNOIDEA. The squared blocks are sawn into thinner slabs using PEDRINI MULTIWIRE JUPITER GS 230, which performs fast block cutting with 72 diamond wires, producing slabs from 2 to 10 centimeters thick.</p>

                    <p class="main__list_mobile-item-description">The sawn slabs undergo a meticulous grinding and polishing process to give them a smooth and shiny surface, revealing the echo of the stone's soul, birthed by nature itself. At our company, the PEDRINI GALAXY B220GX line, equipped with 20 working heads, is used for polishing. This advanced equipment effectively removes all residual defects, giving the slabs incredible shine and sophistication. Thanks to this technology, each slab becomes a true work of art, embodying grandeur and beauty.</p>
