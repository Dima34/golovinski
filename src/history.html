                            The year 1840 was pivotal for the Ukrainian stone-processing industry. In this year, the
                            talented Kyiv physician Shirmer made a discovery that changed the course of history - he
                            found rich deposits of Golovinski labradorite. This unique natural stone, renowned for its
                            exceptional strength and stunning aesthetics, quickly gained popularity among architects and
                            designers. The discovery of Golovinski labradorite became a significant event, laying the

                            a small workshop, they established the largest and oldest stone-processing enterprise in

                            stages – from initial extraction to the finished masterpiece. Owning the quarry opened

                            becoming the key management body for the extraction and processing of stone. Simultaneously,
                            a school for youth apprentices (SHUM) was opened, where young specialists were trained in
                            the art of stone cutting, passing on knowledge and skills in working with labradorite.

                            Between 1931 and 1933, the Volyn Party of the Ukrainian Geological Administration conducted
                            the first geological survey of the deposit, confirming significant labradorite reserves.
                            This research laid the foundation for the company's further development, promoting the
                            introduction of innovative methods for extracting and processing stone.

                            1948, the enterprise was restored with renewed strength. The Slipchytski and Golovinski

                            The period from 1991 to 2019 was a true test for the Golovinski company. Following the

                            challenges. Incompetent management and corruption significantly deteriorated the state of
